1. Project Overview:
    The Example project demonstrates the functionality of GPT Input capture module. GPT4 is used to generate periodic
    pulses of 500 milliseconds duration and provided as input to GPT Input capture (GPT3). GPT3 counts the event pulse
    received at its input. Based on the period and capture event, the time period of pulse is calculated and displayed
    on J-Link RTT Viewer.

2. Software Requirements:
    Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 4.0.0
    e2 studio: Version 2025-12
    GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain: Version 13.3.1.arm-13-24
    SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer: Version 8.60

3. Hardware Requirements:
    RZ supported boards: RZ/G2LC-EVK.
    1 x RZ board.
    1 x USB Type-C cable.

4. Hardware Configurations:
    (1) Boot Mode:
        Boot mode 3 (1.8-V Single, Quad, or Octal serial flash memory).
    (2) Set for DIP switches and jumpers as follow.

5. Hardware Connections:
    (1) Connect the CN6 port on the SMARC Carrier Board to a 5V power source using a USB Type-C cable for board power
        supply.
    (2) Connect the J-Link Base and the connector on the SMARC Module Board with JTAG cable.
        When connecting the conversion adapter "J-Link 9-pin Cortex-M Adapter" made by SEGGER will be required.
    (3) Connect PMOD0 pin 7 and PMOD1 pin 1 on the SMARC Carrier Board.

Note:
1. Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x60110b28
2. If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called
   _SEGGER_RTT) in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).
