1. Project Overview:
    The example projects demonstrates Message Queue and Semaphore between tasks and interrupt. Message Queue is 
    demonstrated between Tasks and between Task and interrupt. GTM timer periodically generates interrupt at 1000msec. 
    For first few seconds, messages are shared between Sender and Receiver Tasks and GTM msgq (Message Queue) ISR. 
    Receiver task pends on Message Queue, receives and displays message received on RTTViewer periodically at 500msec. 
    For next few seconds, Semaphore Task waits for semaphore until it is released by GTM sem (semaphore) ISR. GTM sem 
    ISR releases semaphore periodically at 1000msec. All the tasks run with equal priority level.

2. Software Requirements:
    Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 4.0.0
    e2 studio: Version 2025-12
    GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain: Version 13.3.1.arm-13-24

        +---------------+------------------------------------+

5. Hardware Connections:
    (1) Connect the CN6 port on the SMARC Carrier Board to a USB PD charger using a USB Type-C cable for board power
        supply.
    (2) Connect the J-Link Base and the connector on the SMARC Module Board with JTAG cable.
        When connecting the conversion adapter "J-Link 9-pin Cortex-M Adapter" made by SEGGER will be required.
    (3) Connect PMOD1-3A pins 7–12 on the SMARC Carrier Board to the PMOD LED for LED output control. 

Note:
1. Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x00029a38
2. If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called
   _SEGGER_RTT) in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).
