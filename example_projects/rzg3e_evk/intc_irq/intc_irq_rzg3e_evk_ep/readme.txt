1. Project Overview:
    The example project demonstrates the typical use of the INTC IRQ module APIs. The project initializes the IRQ
    in Interrupt Controller User is requested to press the USER_SW1 push button on Carrier Board to trigger
    the external IRQ and this then will start toggling of user LED (LD2 on PMOD LED).

2. Software Requirements:
    Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 4.0.0
    e2 studio: Version 2025-12
    GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain: Version 13.3.1.arm-13-24
    SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer: Version 8.60

3. Hardware Requirements:
    RZ supported boards: RZ/G3E-EVK.
    1 x RZ board.
    1 x USB Type-C cable.
    1 x PMOD LED module.

4. Hardware Configurations:
    (1) Boot Mode:
        Boot mode 3 (SCIF Downloading) with CA55 cold boot.

    (2) Set for DIP switches and jumpers as follow.

        +---------------+----------------------------------------+

5. Hardware Connections:
    (1) Connect the USB-C PWR_IN port on the SMARC Carrier Board to a USB PD charger using a USB Type-C cable 
        for board power supply.
    (2) Connect the J-Link Base and the connector on the SMARC Module Board with JTAG cable.
        When connecting the conversion adapter "J-Link 9-pin Cortex-M Adapter" made by SEGGER will be required.
    (3) Connect PMOD1-6A pins 7–12 on the SMARC Carrier Board to the PMOD LED for LED output control. 

Note:
1. Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x08005ff8
2. If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called
   _SEGGER_RTT) in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).
