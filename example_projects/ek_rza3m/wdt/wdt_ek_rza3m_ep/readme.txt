1. Project Overview:
    The example project demonstrates the use of WDT module with the collaboration of module IRQ, GTM, WDT and button/LED. 
    The operation of this example is as below:
    - Start GTM timer having a callback every 1 second, to refresh WDT and blink the LED (User LED1 on board).
    - If the User SW1 on board is pressed, IRQ is triggered, the LED (User LED1 on board) is OFF and program is exit.

2. Software Requirements:
    Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 4.2.0
    e2 studio: Version 2026-07
    GCC ARM A-Profile (AArch64 bare-metal): Version 13.2 rel1
    Terminal Console Application: Tera Term or a similar application

3. Hardware Requirements:
    RZ supported boards: EK-RZ/A3M.
    1 x RZ board.
    1 x USB Type-C cable.

4. Hardware Configurations:
    (1) Boot Mode:
        Boot mode 4 (3.3-V Single or Quad serial NOR flash memory).

    (2) Set for DIP switches as follow to select boot mode 4 and peripheral pins:
        +===============+==========================+
        | Board setting | EK-RZ/A3M                |
        +===============+==========================+
        | Module board  | SW4-1  : OFF (Default)   |
        |               | SW4-2  : OFF (Default)   |
        |               | SW4-3  : OFF (Default)   |
        |               | SW4-4  : OFF (Default)   |
        |               | SW4-5  : OFF             |
        |               |                          |
        |               | SW5-1  : OFF             |
        |               | SW5-2  : OFF             |
        |               | SW5-3  : OFF (Default)   |
        |               | SW5-4  : OFF             |
        |               | SW5-5  : OFF (Default)   |
        +---------------+--------------------------+

    (3) The user needs to place jumper J9 on pins 2-3 to use on-board debug functionality.

5. Hardware Connections:
    (1) Connect the DEBUG1 port (J10) of the RZ board to the PC using a USB Type-C cable for board power supply, debugging, and
        serial terminal communication (Tera Term).

Note:
1. Set the configuration of Terminal Emulator (Tera Term) as follows:
   Port: is COM port provided by the RZ board.
   Speed: 115200 bps
   Data: 8 bit  
   Parity: none
   Stop bits: 1 bit
   Flow control: none
