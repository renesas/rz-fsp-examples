1. Project Overview:
    The example projects demonstrates Message Queue and Semaphore between tasks and interrupt. Message Queue is 
    demonstrated between Tasks and between Task and interrupt. GTM timer periodically generates interrupt at 1000msec. 
    For first few seconds, messages are shared between Sender and Receiver Tasks and GTM msgq (Message Queue) ISR. 
    Receiver task pends on Message Queue, receives and displays message received on TeraTerm periodically at 500msec. 
    For next few seconds, Semaphore Task waits for semaphore until it is released by GTM sem (semaphore) ISR. GTM sem 
    ISR releases semaphore periodically at 1000msec. All the tasks run with equal priority level.

2. Software Requirements:
    Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 4.0.0
    e2 studio: Version 2025-12
    GCC ARM A-Profile (AArch64 bare-metal): Version 13.2 rel1
    Terminal Console Application: Tera Term or a similar application

3. Hardware Requirements:
    RZ supported boards: EK-RZ/A3M.
    1 x RZ board.
    1 x USB Type-C cable.

4. Hardware Configurations:
    (1) Boot Mode:
        Boot mode 4 (3.3-V Single or Quad serial NOR flash memory).

    (2) Set for DIP switches as follow to select boot mode 4 and peripheral pins:
        +===============+==========================+
        | Board setting | EK-RZ/A3M                |
        +===============+==========================+
        | Module board  | SW4-1  : OFF (Default)   |
        |               | SW4-2  : OFF (Default)   |
        |               | SW4-3  : OFF (Default)   |
        |               | SW4-4  : OFF (Default)   |
        |               | SW4-5  : OFF             |
        |               |                          |
        |               | SW5-1  : OFF             |
        |               | SW5-2  : OFF             |
        |               | SW5-3  : OFF (Default)   |
        |               | SW5-4  : OFF             |
        |               | SW5-5  : OFF (Default)   |
        +---------------+--------------------------+

    (3) The user needs to place jumper J9 on pins 2-3 to use on-board debug functionality.

5. Hardware Connections:
    Connect the DEBUG1 port of the RZ board to the PC using a USB Type-C cable for board power supply, debugging, and
    serial terminal communication (Tera Term).
