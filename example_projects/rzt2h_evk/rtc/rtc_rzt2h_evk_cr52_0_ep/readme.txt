1. Project Overview:
    This example project demonstrates the use of the Real-Time Clock (RTC) on the
    RZ/T2H microprocessor. It initializes the RTC module with a start calendar time and enables.
    a 1-second periodic interrupt. On each periodic interrupt, the current calendar time is read
    and displayed via the RTT Viewer.
    A hardware alarm is configured to trigger when the hour and minute match and
    the current day-of-week is enabled. Any API failure is also displayed on the console.

2. Software Requirements:
    Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 4.1.0
    e2 studio: Version 2026-04.1
    GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain: Version 13.3.1.arm-13-24
    SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer: Version 8.60

3. Hardware Requirements:
    RZ supported boards: RZ/T2H-EVK.
    1 x RZ board.
    1 x USB Type-C cable.
    1 x USB Type-A to micro USB cable.

4. Hardware Configurations:
    (1) Boot Mode:
        xSPI1 boot mode (x1 boot serial flash).
    (2) Set for DIP switches and jumpers as follow.
        - The operating mode of the RZ/T2H : xSPI1 boot mode (x1 boot serial flash)
          SW14.1 : ON
          SW14.2 : OFF
          SW14.3 : ON
          SW14.6 : OFF

        - CPU0 ATCM wait cycle = 1 wait cycle
          SW14.4 : OFF

5. Hardware Connections:
    (1) Connect the CN14 port on evaluation board to the PC using USB Micro-B cable for debugging.
    (2) Connect the CN46 port on evaluation board to a power source using a USB Type-C cable for board power supply.
    (3) Slide SW16 "POWER_SW" from OFF to ON side to turn on the power supply for evaluation board.

Note:
1. Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x10180000

2. If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called
   _SEGGER_RTT) in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).
