1. Project Overview:
    This example project demonstrates a typical use case of the DMAC module. It initializes the DMAC functionality 
    and performs data transfers from a source array located in ATCM to a destination array.
    The transfers are triggered using both a software trigger and a CMTW compare match event.
    Upon successful completion, the received data is displayed in the Tera Term.
    Any API/event failure message is also displayed.

2. Software Requirements:
    Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 4.0.0
    e2 studio: Version 2025-12
    GCC ARM A-Profile (AArch64 bare-metal): Version 13.2 rel1
    Terminal Console Application: Tera Term or a similar application

3. Hardware Requirements:
    RZ supported boards: RZ/T2H-EVK.
    1 x RZ board.
    1 x USB Type-C cable.
    1 x USB Type-A to micro USB cable.
    1 x USB Type-A to USB Mini-B cable.

4. Hardware Configurations:
    (1) Boot Mode:
