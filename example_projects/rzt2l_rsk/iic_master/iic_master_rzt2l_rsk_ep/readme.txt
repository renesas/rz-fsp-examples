1. Project Overview:
    The example project demonstrates the typical use of the IIC master HAL module APIs.
    The project initializes IIC master module with fast mode and interfaces with PmodACL™ Board for ADXL345.

    On power up after establishing the connection of sensor with the board, it displays accelerometer axis data on
    RTTviewer. Any API/event failure will be displayed on RTTviewer.

2. Software Requirements:
    Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 4.0.0
    e2 studio: Version 2025-12
    GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain: Version 13.3.1.arm-13-24
    SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer: Version 8.60

3. Hardware Requirements:
    RZ supported boards: RZ/T2L-RSK.
    1 x RZ board.
    1 x USB Type-C cable.
    1 x USB Type-A to micro USB cable.
    1 x Pmod ACL.

4. Hardware Configurations:
    (1) Boot Mode:
        xSPI0 boot mode (x1 boot serial flash).
    (2) Set for DIP switches and jumpers as follow:
    Hardware Connection:

        1. *SW4 settings must be below to start this sample program.
        SW4.1 : ON
        SW4.2 : ON
        SW4.3 : ON

        2. *This sample program runs on TCM and CPU frequency is set to 800MHz in the start up process.
        Therefore, the following settings (MDW = 1) are required.
        SW4.4 : OFF

        3. *This sample program uses (I2C)
        Therefore, the following settings are required.
        SW8.10 : OFF

        4. *Configuring the RSK board circuit
        Connect IIC(Slave) to J21 and J22 of mikroBUS™.
        Pins : Master side  - Slave side
        ------------------------------------
        SCL  : J22.5(P21_1) - J2.5
        SDA  : J22.6(P21_2) - J2.6
        p3v3 : J21.7        - J2.8
        GND  : J21.8        - J2.7
        ------                       -------
        (RZ/T2L RSK uses IIC1)

Note:
1. Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x30080000

2. If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).
