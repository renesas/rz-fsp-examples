1. Project Overview:
    This example project demonstrates the functionality of INTC_IRQ driver. On pressing the user push button, an 
    external IRQ is triggered, which toggles LED on PMOD LED.

2. Software Requirements:
    Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 4.0.0
    e2 studio: Version 2025-12
    GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain: Version 13.3.1.arm-13-24
    SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer: Version 8.60

3. Hardware Requirements:
    RZ supported boards: RZ/V2L-EVK.
    1 x RZ board.
    1 x USB Type-C cable.
    1 x PMOD LED module.
    1 x PMOD BUTTON module.

4. Hardware Configurations:
    (1) Boot Mode:
        Boot mode 3 (1.8-V Single, Quad, or Octal serial flash memory).

    (2) Set for DIP switches and jumpers as follow:

        |                | SW11-1 : OFF                   |
        |                | SW11-2 : OFF                   |
        |                | SW11-3 : OFF                   |
        |                | SW11-4 : ON                    |
        |                |                                |
        |                | CN4    : Jumper connects 1-3   |
        |                |          Jumper connects 2-4   |
        +----------------+--------------------------------+

5. Hardware Connections:
    (1) Connect the CN6 port on the SMARC Carrier Board to a 5V power source using a USB Type-C cable for board power
        supply.
    (2) Connect the J-Link Base and the connector on the SMARC Module Board with a JTAG cable for debugging.
        When connecting the conversion adapter "J-Link 9-pin Cortex-M Adapter" made by SEGGER will be required.
    (3) Connect PMOD0 pins 7–12 on the SMARC Carrier Board to the PMOD LED for LED output control (LD2).
        Connect PMOD1 pins 7–12 on the SMARC Carrier Board to the PMOD BUTTON for user input (BTN0).
